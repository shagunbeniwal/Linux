Changing the bash prompt to show IP
To get the following output as your shell prompt --> [root@192.168.1.9 ~]# 

Theory :
The bash shell prompt comes the way it is because of the $PS1 variable in your linux environment.
You can echo from command line and check the present value of PS1 variable by --> echo $PS1

Step 1: echo $PS1 value and save the value to a file, it is always good to take a back up of files and config before changing system config.
Step 2: sudo nano ~/.bashrc
Step 3: Add the following line to the end of the file
export PS1="[\u@$(ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0. | awk '{print $2}' | tr ":" " " | awk '{print $2}') \W]#"
Step 4: Restart the shell session to see the changes.
